# Choose Your Own Adventure
Welcome to the Clash Royale Interactive Story Game!
This is a fun, text-based Python game where your choices directly affect the storyline.
You will face bizarre scenarios, save (or doom) your family, and possibly win 1 billion dollars, all based on your decisions.
## Overview
This project is a Python program that:
- Presents a branching choose-your-own-adventure story.
- Uses user input to decide what happens next.
- Includes dramatic pauses using Python's time.sleep() to build suspense.
- Demonstrates Python fundamentals like:
    - if/elif/else statements
    - input() handling
    - String methods such as .lower()  

Here's a flowchart which explains the way my program works
